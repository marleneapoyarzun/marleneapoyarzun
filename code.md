## Stata Programs
### [**sdid**](https://github.com/Daniel-Pailanir/sdid) - Synthetic Difference-in-Differences

This Stata package implements the synthetic difference-in-differences estimation procedure, along with a range of inference procedures, following Arkhangelsky et al., (2021). Here we provide a native Stata implementation, principally written in Mata. This package is currently under active development. You can see the latest version at [**sdid**](https://github.com/Daniel-Pailanir/sdid).


### [**recocl**](https://econpapers.repec.org/software/bocbocode/S458893.htm) - Recodes municipality's codes for Chile (CL)

Chile has changed his municipal code a couple of times. Currently, not all databases have the most current municipality code, therefore it is necessary to carry out a recoding of the municipality code for some municipalities in region I (Arica y Parinacota), VIII (Bío-Bío) and X (Los Ríos). This is exactly what recocl does.

**Note:** Install in Stata typing _ssc install **recocl**_.

### [**grvar**](https://econpapers.repec.org/software/bocbocode/s458802.htm) - Apply a non-constant growth rate to a variable

Calculate the future values of a variable from the initial value and a non-constant growth/decrease rate (e.g. inflation). It is useful when we want to fit a variable with a growth rate in a time serie or panel data.
